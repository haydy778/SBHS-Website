# SBHS-Website

This project was originally going to be a complete remake of the Southland Boys' High School website with all the pages having been created. That project was massive and was going to be very time consuming. My teacher mentioned that I should focus on certain aspects of the school instead of doing the whole website. So I decided to just make the home page and a chess, debating, choir, hockey and rugby pages. This was much more achievable target. My footer however used similar menus to the current website so that is inactive at this time and those pages would be active if the whole project was completed and is a current space filler for now. I am also a photographer, this helped me in making the website as I could use my own images that I had taken around the school. With the help of other photographers in the photography class I was able to use some of my classmates images for the website as well. All other images I used that weren't my own were credited with a title attribute on the images. 

## Relevant Implications

### Aesthetic  
- Because the current SBHS website is outdated now it needs to have a change of design and be aesthetically pleasing to the users. The home page should be the most aesthetically pleasing as it is the first thing that the user sees when they go on the website. 
### Functionality 
- This website needed to be functional so parents and students can learn about the school and see what we do and why we are so exceptional. Without a functional website the Parents won't be able to get to school bridge get contact details see the school calendar for events 
### Accessibility
- I made the website to be accessible for all users whether they are visually impaired or they aren't as tech-savy as younger people. As my target audience is parents/caregivers/students this means that all age groups must be able to navigate the site.
