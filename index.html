                    Southland Boys’ High School is a traditional school with a contemporary heart. The combination of
                    old and
                    new, our values and the school motto, Not for School but for Life we are Learning, are deeply
                    embedded
                    in all aspects of the school’s life. Education is about success across a wide range of activities in
                    academic endeavours, cultural pursuits and sport.

                    At Southland Boys’ High School, the timetable, curriculum, method of delivery and co-curricular
                    activities are deliberately designed to meet the needs and aspirations of young men. Our staff are
                    determined to establish a school with a strong sense of family and belonging and have a deep respect
                    for
                    heritage and traditions, but at the same time, are continually looking ahead to innovations in
                    curriculum to enhance the learning of our boys.
